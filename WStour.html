						<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b>The growing tourism in the Western-Southern more visitors are travelling to this lesser-explored part of India. While all states welcome tourists, however, certain parts of Nagaland and Manipur should be avoided due to insurgency situations. It will be wise to take the advice of local experts on the places to avoid and on current situations. Also, book your North East tour package with a reliable tour operator that knows the area well.<br><br>

						<b>-</b> you are about to finalise one of the Western-Southern holiday packages and are a wildlife lover, make sure your holiday incorporates trips to some of its most incredible national parks. Arrive in Assam for a look at the one-horned rhinoceros, the state animal. The best place to view them in their natural habitat is at the Pobitora National Park, Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park. You can go on an elephant-back or jeep safari and spot them in the wild grazing. While the parks offer ideal grassland and wetland habitat for the Indian rhinoceros, they are also teeming with an array of other wildlife that includes birds, big cats and reptiles.<br><br> 
						
						<b>-</b> 
						Ahead of shortlisting one of the Western-Southern packages you need to first figure out your travels and how you would reach your destination. Guwahati in Assam is the gateway to the Northeast and there are direct flights from Delhi and all the other metros of the country to Guwahati. You have airlines like GoFirst, SpiceJet, national carrier Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and AirAsia with direct flights from New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport to Guwahati’s Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport taking approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.
